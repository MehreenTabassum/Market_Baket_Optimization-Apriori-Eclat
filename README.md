# Market_Basket_Optimization-Apriori-Eclat
This repository is based on optimizing Market Basket using Apriori and Eclat algorithms from association rule learning models. 
# Project Overview:
The Market Basket Optimization project is based on data collected from market basket transactions to extract meaningful insights. By using apriori and eclat algorithms this project finds the association among items and unravel the patterns about most frequently purchased items. 
# Problem Statement
Retails businesses has to deal with a large volume of daily transactions, making it essential for them to identify relationships between products to:
* Increase cross-sell opportunities
* Increase customer shopping experiences
* Optimize the store layouts
# Approach
We have utilized two well-known association learning algorithms:
## 1. Apriori Algorithm
The **Apriori Algorithm** uses "bottom-up" approach for generating frequent itemsets. It uses a simple and intuitive method for mining frequent patterns. It can be computationally expensive for large datasets. 
## 2. Eclat Algorithm
The **Eclat (Equivalnece Class Transformation) Algorithm** is a depth-first search algorithm that uses intersection-based methods to generate frequent itemsets eficiently. It is faster and memory-efficient yet complicated to implement than Apriori. 
# Usage 
To run the Market Basket Optimization with both algorithms:
1. Prepare your dataset (CSV format)
2. Run the sript
3. Adjust the support, confidence, and lift thresholds in the script for fine-tuning.
